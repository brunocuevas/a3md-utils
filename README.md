# A3MD - utils

## Summary

A3MDutils provides some useful classes and scripts that I developped
for my main project, A3MD. You can employ it to:
- generate inputs for ORCA and Gaussian
- compile QM electron density information in H5 files 
- rotate coordinates of MOL2 files
- extract forces from QM files

To interact with these scripts, you can just call the a3mdutils script.
